# Self-Driving Car Simulation

This project simulates a self-driving car using computer vision and basic AI algorithms. It utilizes OpenCV to process visual data, enabling the car to navigate autonomously within a controlled environment.

##  Overview

The goal of this project is to explore core self-driving technologies such as lane detection, object recognition, and autonomous navigation using Python and OpenCV.

##  Features

- **Object Detection**  
  Identifies obstacles, lanes, and key features in the environment to maintain a safe driving path.

- **Lane Following**  
  Uses vision-based algorithms to detect and follow road lanes in real time.

- **Collision Avoidance**  
  Integrates algorithms to detect obstacles and automatically adjust the path to prevent collisions.

- **Real-Time Processing**  
  Analyzes video frames on the fly to ensure accurate and responsive navigation.

- **Tracking Vehicles and Pedestrians Behind the Car**  
  Detects and tracks vehicles or people approaching from the rear to enhance safety and awareness.

- **Speed Estimation**  
  Estimates the vehicle's speed using image processing and motion analysis.

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Basic AI/ML techniques
