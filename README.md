##  Introduction

### Context & Motivation
Urban parking management has become a major issue due to the continuous increase in vehicle numbers. Drivers often spend excessive time searching for parking, leading to:
- Higher fuel consumption  
- Increased CO‚ÇÇ emissions  
- Traffic congestion  

This project proposes an **autonomous robotic solution** capable of detecting available parking spaces, avoiding obstacles, and maintaining a **real-time parking map**.

### Value Added
-  **Innovative Solution:** Automates parking management to enhance efficiency.  
-  **Low-Cost Design:** Built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and LIDAR for affordability.  
-  **Modular Architecture:** Supports future extensions like license plate recognition.  
-  **Eco-Friendly Impact:** Reduces unnecessary vehicle movements and emissions.
